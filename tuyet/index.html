		<h2>Our Mission</h2>
		<p>San Joaquin Valley Town Hall is a non-profit organization that is
			run by an all-volunteer board of directors. Our mission is to bring nationally and internationally renowned, thought-provoking speakers who inform, educate, and entertain our audience! As one or our members told us:</p>
		<blockquote><i>&quot;Each year I give a ticket package to each of our family members. I think of it as the gift of knowledge...and that is priceless.&quot;</i></blockquote>
		<h2>Our Ticket Packages</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Season Package: &dollar;95</li>
			<li>Patron Package: &dollar;200</li>
			<li>Single Speaker: &dollar;25</li>
		</ul>
